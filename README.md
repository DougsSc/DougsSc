I am a Software Developer with a degree in Computer Engineering and a postgraduate degree in Software Architecture, with over 6 years of experience dedicated to mobile development. My journey includes specialization in the creation and improvement of solutions for multiple sectors, including primarily e-commerce, urban mobility and corporate management.

I have a solid knowledge of the Flutter framework and the Dart language, as well as experience in Java and Swift, which allows me to perform high-quality native implementations for iOS and Android. My knowledge covers state management using Bloc pattern, Provider, ChangeNotifier, ValueNotifier and MobX, as well as Design Systems, using tools like Figma and XD. I am familiar with Firebase and apply CI/CD methodologies daily, using tools such as Git, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps, ensuring the continuous and efficient delivery of solutions.

My approach involves not only the application of programming techniques but also a solid understanding of design concepts such as Clean Architecture, MVC, MVVM, and coding practices like SOLID, TDD and Design Patterns. I value collaboration in agile environments, where I actively participate in rituals that apply the Scrum and Kanban methodologies.

I am a person who learns very easily and adapts to any scenario, and I am always seeking new challenges that allow me to grow professionally. I believe that technology has the power to transform the world and I am eager to contribute to projects that make a difference.
